#### Features:

* Autocompleting delivery address using Bing Maps API
* Multilingual
* Handling API requests states (loading/error)

---

#### Pitfalls:

* There's no real back-end. App works on mocks, so you may find weird things like "Tasty shoes" as restaurant dish name.
* No payments module included
* Missing order validation (user may order food from UK with delivery to Poland)


---

#### Developer notes:
* Recommended Node version: **18.0.0**
* See available scripts in `package.json`
* App works on mocked backend (msw + faker.js)
